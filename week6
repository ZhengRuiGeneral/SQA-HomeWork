comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives



Testing vs. Formal verification

    Tesing is important link in development process
    Different development phases
    

Testing vs. Inspection
    
    Existence of the implemented product
    
    Levels of quality/defects
    
    Static vs. dynamic defects

    Localized vs. interconnected defects

    Combined approaches
    
    Phases and transitions
    
    Inspection of testing entities/processes
    

Testing vs. Preventive actions

    Different applicability to maintenance
    
    Objects QA activities applied on different things: executable code vs dev. activities

    Different development phases: testing phase and later vs defect prevention on 

    General expertise levels: low vs high

    Problem or defect types:dynamic failures & related faults VS. negating causes or pre-conditions to pervasive problems

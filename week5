Form methods

Formal methods  can help  software or hardware so that to validate it reach its requirement. They are based on formal 
program and provide a high level of insurance . Otherwise, they are really costly in resources. 

Model checking

Model checking consists of three parts:
 Based upon the proposition temporal logic specification language；
 Authentication system indicates the encoding method is the state machine ；
Authentication algorithm for intelligent search of the state space to determine specification is true or false. 
If the specification is not implemented, the model test can give a counterexample.

It need to consider increasing efficiency and reducing memory space requirements, in addition, studies to reduce the need
to verify the nature of the model itself or complexity, there are different types of main methods abstract slicing model 
decomposition, validation nature.
